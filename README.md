# Documentation and Usage

## Quick Overview

`lammps-post` is a Python-based utility for parsing, loading, and analyzing data from output files written during LAMMPS molecular dyanmics simulations. Currently, `lammps-post` defines the following objects:   

 * `ThermoOut('path/to/thermodynamic-output-file')`- reads thermodynamic info controlled by the [thermo](https://docs.lammps.org/thermo.html), [thermo_style](https://docs.lammps.org/thermo_style.html), and [thermo_modify](https://docs.lammps.org/thermo_modify.html) commands from a file (e.g., log.lammps) and parses the data into a Pandas `DataFrame` which can be used for subsequent analyses.
    * If the file contains outputs from multiple sequential runs, a particular run can loaded using the `run_number` option: `ThermoOut('path/to/thermodynamic-output-file', run_number=0)`
 * `AveChunk('path/to/ave-chunk-output-file')` - read and parse chunk averaged outputs from files generated by the LAMMPS [fix ave/chunk](https://docs.lammps.org/fix_ave_chunk.html) command. The AveChunk class will parse the ave/chunk output file and extract the data into a set of Pandas DataFrames.

### Examples

See the following notebooks:
  * [ThermoOut-Example](jupyter-notebooks/ThermoOut-Example.ipynb)
  * [AveChunk-Example](jupyter-notebooks/AveChunk-Example.ipynb)
